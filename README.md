# Speech-Recognition_Voice-Changer

### Authors: Adelina Taralunga & Florin Drilea

## Functionality

In terms of functionality, our ’Voice Changer’ contains three main features. Firstly,
the user can modify the settings, such as setting the level of the volume, the type of
input that is fed into the system (i.e. live input or file input). The standard configuration of the system is set to ’live input’, which is updated immediately depending
on what the microphone will register from the surroundings. There is also an option
to record, which will be saved in a file. Secondly, even though the user does not have
any expertise in speech processing, they can still test the effects of applying delay
filters or choosing predefined sets, such as Dalek (the original recording is modified
and imitates the voice of the famous character from the TV series ’Doctor Who’).
The presets and filters can benefit any type of user as they do not require more
than a click to see the results. The changes can be heard, as well as observed in the
waveforms. Finally, the user can customise various settings to create custom sound
effects.

## Design/ Layout

The design of our GUI is user-friendly for the reasons that similar functionalities are
placed together on the canvas as well as having clear labels for their purpose. The
objects are created taking into consideration common sense. It makes it easier for
the users to perform actions intuitively, for example, if they want to record for some
time, they click a button as they are used to do on any device. We are making use
of colours to distinguish between different functionalities available in the system.

## Innovations

There are various graphical outputs including volume meter and a waveform to make
it user-friendly and attractive. There are also multiple filters created, which make it
more fun to use the system and less time-consuming, in terms of deciding and setting
the right values. The option to control the level of the volume is also available on the
interface.
